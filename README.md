## Overview
This application is an innovative blend of past and present, bringing an old-fashioned standoff experience to your Apple Watch. Using the power of Swift, Python, Turi Create, and Pandas, it simulates a fun-filled, competitive standoff game between two users.

Duel leverages an advanced activity classification machine learning model to accurately detect users' motions. Furthermore, with the power of Multipeer Connectivity, it allows short-range communication between users' devices, providing real-time interaction and results.

## Features
- Real-time motion detection
- User-friendly interface
- Short-range multi-device communication
- Accurate results through advanced machine learning algorithms
- Multi-player standoff game simulation

## Technologies Used
- **Swift**: The core of our application, used for the user interface and business logic on the Apple Watch.
